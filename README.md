# Musical Instrument Classification

Mohamed ElSalmi



PROBLEM STATEMENT

The purpose of this project is to classify Music Instrument according to their different attributes. I shall be implementing an assortment of different classifiers from supervised approached to Convolutional Neural Networks. In order to do I will convert the audio files to spectrograms. The priority for this project is accuracy, hence, I shall aim to implement different architectures whilst also testing the viability of pre-trained models. This project relies heavily on Librosa to process and explore the wave files, SKLearn&#39;s packages for Supervised training and PyTorch/fast.ai for CNN Networks.

# Data Set

For this project I shall be using Google&#39;s NSynth Dataset, a large-scale and high-quality dataset of annotated musical notes. This dataset has gone through rigorous pre-processing, includes no missing values, incorrect classifications or duplicate entries. The dataset itself is quite substantial, with more than 300,000 four-second audio snippets alongside JSON files containing non audio features.

### Hardware: AWS - g4dn.4xlarge instance, 16 vCPU, 1 NVIDIA T4 GPU

### Software:

1. Python 3.6
2. Librosa 0.7.2
3. fast.ai 1.0.60
